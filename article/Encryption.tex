\section{Introduction}
  Encryption is a powerful tool to protect your information, but standard
  encryption can be insecure if found. Additionally, it can be incriminating
  if found, so that is why hiding the encrypted information is more important
  then ever. The art and science of hiding information in plain sight is 
  called stenography. This document describes the design and implementation
  of such a system to encrypt and hide information inside of a standard 
  image file.

  \subsection{A Note About the Code in this Article}
    The code samples featured in this article are written in C-style C++11.
    This means that the code featured in this article makes use of c-style
    arrays and direct bit manipulation. The main reason the code samples
    featured in this article are written in C++11 is the use of standardized 
    fixed-width integers included in the standard library.

\section{Encryption and Decryption}
  The encryption used in this system is a simple XOR rotation cipher.
  The cipher uses an n-byte key to encrypt and decrypt the message.
  Along with the use of a rotating key, this a relatively fast and
  secure algorithim, though probably nowhere near as secure as any of
  public-private key algorithims. However, this algorithim was not
  designed with that in mind, this algorithim was designed with the
  thought of protecting a file against a cursory overview.
  
  As this algorithim uses a rotating key to encrypt mesages there
  must be regular pattern to how the key changes. As such the
  change to the key is a simple bit rotation after each use. 

  % Equation describing the value of K to use in this iteration
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:keyDerive}
    K_i = rotateRight(
        \underbrace{K_i \bmod length(K)}_\text{Value to rotate},
        \underbrace{\frac{i}{length(K)} \bmod (sizeof(type(K)) 
            \times B)}_\text{places}) 
  \end{equation}

  Equation \eqref{eq:keyDerive} describes how to calculate the key value to use
  in iteration \( i \) of the encryption algorithim. It requires the use
  of a bitwise rotate operation so that no data is lost, through the
  replacement by zeros when using standard bitwise shifts. And as zeros
  are introduced into the key, the resulting value of an XOR would no
  longer work as a key, because the encoded values would remain the same.

  This algorithim can use an n-bit key as the new key value is
  determined independtly of the length of the key and provides
  facilities for working with various key lengths. As such it can use
  a n-bit key for encryption and decryption.

  The encryption algorithim requires the use of the bitwise XOR and
  takes advantage of the speed yielded with an XOR operation, due to
  no carry bits being required, and dedicated circuitry existing on most
  modern processors. Below is a description of the algorithim in detail.

  \subsection{Encrypting a Message}
    This section describes the process of encrypting a message.
    The general process of encrypting a message using an xor rotate
    cipher is quite simple, but it becomes more complex with the
    addition of a rotating key. The general process of encryption
    using an XOR rotation cipher is descriped below. 
    
    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \For{$i=0; i < length(OriginalMessage); i++$}
      \State $EncryptedMesage_i =
             OriginalMessage_i \oplus Key_{i \bmod length(Key)}$
      \State $EncryptedMessage_i = rotateRight(EncryptedMessage_i$
    \EndFor 
    \end{algorithmic}
    \caption{A Basic XOR rotation cipher}
    \end{figure}

    If there was nothing more than an XOR opperation in this algorithim,
    it would be incredibly easy to use a brute-force attack against.
    However, since a bit rotation was added into the algorithim, there
    are now \(CHAR\_BITS^2\) possible solutions to the message, making
    brute-forcing it, less of an option. However, the key is still
    vurnable to being brute-forced, so modification of the key is also
    required. Yielding, something more like the following.
    
    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \label{fig:ImprovRotCiph}
    \For{ $i=0; i < length(OriginalMessage); i++$}
      \State $EncryptedMessage_i =
             OriginalMessage_i \oplus Key_{i \bmod length(Key)}$
      \State $EncryptedMessage_i = rotateRight(EncryptedMessage_i)$
      \If{$( i \bmod length(Key) ) \equiv 0$}
        \For{ $j=0;j < length(Key); j++$ }
          \State $Key_j = rotateRight(Key_j)$
        \EndFor
      \EndIf
    \EndFor
    \end{algorithmic}
    \caption{An Improved XOR rotation cipher}
    \end{figure}
    
    As you can see the second example is much more confusing, as it involves
    manipulation of the actual key. As more confusion is better in 
    cryptography the second algorithim is much better.
    Additionally, the encryption process can be described as a mathmatical
    formula, as seen in equation \eqref{eq:Encrypt}. With \(K_i\) as defined
    in equation \eqref{eq:keyDerive}.
    
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:Encrypt}
      E_{i} = rotateRight(M_{i} \oplus K_{i})   
    \end{equation}

    \subsubsection{Programming an Encryption Algorithim}
    Now to implement such an algorithim in C++, we need to perform several
    checks before we can even begin. First of all, nulls must be
    checked for, as three parameters are pointers, and can be null. As writing
    to a null pointer would cause a segmentation fault, it must be checked for.
    Therefore, the encryption function should start with a couple of standard
    asserts or macro that does the same thing. Additionally, memory allocation
    sizes must be checked, otherwise the encryption function might write to
    memory that the program hasn't  been allocated, causing another
    segmentation fault. Finally, the encryption key must be copied into
    local memory as the Key is passed by pointer, and can be modified within
    that function and returned via pointer, the encryption key might be used
    in other parts of the program and should be treated as constant memory.
    Therefore, there are several checks to be made before even running the
    algorithim.
    
    Additionally, the implemented algorithim must defend against cold-boot
    attacks, so the usage of memory that clears itself after being used
    is a must. This is especially important where the encryption key
    was stored. Therefore, a for loop is used to clear the allocated memory
    before the encryption function returns to the caller. Also, the
    encryption program must defend against multiple other kinds of attacks,
    most of which depend on finding the encryption key sitting somewhere
    in memory, therefore the encryption keys used in this program shouldn't
    look like normal keys at all, to protect against such an attack.
    
    Now, when implementing the actual algorithim your function will require
    six parameters to be passed to it, if one is implementing it in C/C++.
    Three parameters are pointers to hold the input, output, and the key, the
    rest are to hold the amount of memory allocated to each pointer. When
    implementing the for loops, a 64-bit counter will be necessary due to the
    possibly large amount of input data.

\subsection{Decrypting a message}
    Decryption is just undoing what has been done to a message, now a
    good cipher will have many differint possibilities to defeat most
    cryptoanalysis methods. In other words, decryption is just inverse
    operations. However, this doesn't work so well if one is trying to
    break an encryption algorithim, as  a good algorithim would use a
    key and have hundreds of millions of possibilities. Thus, rendering
    a brute force approach impossible. As such to decrypt our message,
    we need 

    However, decryption is just an inversion of the encyption algorithim,
    as such we can implement it in revese as such, see the listing below.

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \For{ $i=0; i < length(EncryptedMessage); i++$}
      \State $EncryptedMessage_i = rotateLeft(EncryptedMessage_i)$
      \State $DecryptedMessage_i = EncryptedMessage_i \oplus 
                                   Key_{i \bmod length(Key)}$
      \If{$(i \bmod length(Key)) \equiv 0$}
        \For{ $j=0;j < length(Key); j++$ }
          \State $Key_j = rotateRight(Key_j)$
        \EndFor
      \EndIf
    \EndFor
    \end{algorithmic}
    \caption{A reversal of an XOR rotation cipher}
    \end{figure}

    To undo the encryption algorithim, the key used to encrypt the message
    originally, and the exact operations used to encrypt the message must
    be done in reverse, however the operations performed on the key must be
    exactly the same operations originally if the encrypted message is being
    iterated forwards, in order to keep the key consistant with the message.
    
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:XORinversion}
      (n \oplus k) \oplus k = n
    \end{equation}

    As the operations performed to decrypt a message using an XOR rotation
    cipher must be done in reverse from the encrpytion, meaning the first
    operation performed is bitwise rotate left. Then, the resulting value
    have an XOR operation performed on it with the key used for that index
    during encryption. As XOR is its own inverse operation as shown in
    equation \eqref{eq:XORinversion}, the XOR operation remains in the
    decryption algorithim.

    \subsubsection{Programming a Decryption Algorithim}
    Implementing a decryption algorithim is a bit more challenging than
    implementing an encryption algorithim. As some encrypted data can include
    some padding in the actual message, or in other words garbage information.
    Recognizing the padding can be a major challenge, as some messages might
    have padding, while other messages might not.

    assert(inlen <= outlen);
    assert(KEY != NULL);
    assert(instr != NULL);
    assert(outstr != NULL);
    uint8_t *KeyCopy = new uint8_t[keyLen];
    memcpy(KeyCopy, KEY, keyLen);

        outstr[i] = rotateLeft(instr[i], 1);
        outstr[i] = outstr[i] ^ KeyCopy[i % keyLen];
        if((i % keyLen) == 0){
            for(int j = 0; j < keyLen; j++){
                KeyCopy[j] = rotateRight(KeyCopy[j], 1);

\section{Stenography}
  Stenography is the practice on hiding a message. The goal is take
  a message and make sure that it gets to where it needs to get by
  making the message appear to not be a message. After all, if one
  does not know a message exists, they can not intercept it. Therefore,
  stenography should be an intergral part of the message sending process.
  
  \subsection{Image Stenography}
    As images are a very common feature in the modern internet browsing
    experience, making it not hard to see that hiding a message inside of an
    image is a great idea. However, most images found in modern web pages
    are compressed images, which can either be lossless or lossy. Lossy
    compression is bad for stenography in images as it causes the loss
    of data in the image, and can corrupt the message. As such lossless
    compression, which doesn't change the byte values of each pixel, 
    thus making it superior for stenography.

    \subsubsection{Implementing Stenography}
    Implementing stenography with images requires use of a library, so
    as to provide an easy way to write out to multiple formats. As such,
    the library being used to implement this solution is the CImg library
    \cite{cimg}.
